Installing nesscary prerequsites

To install all the needed software there is a install_fedora file in install_scripts
directory. This has ben tested and will install all needed software on fedora 19.

Installing Wordlists
====================

Any words you want can be added to the wordlists that are used in the semantic
analysis stage. Adding them to the database can be done manually or you can
use some wordlists from the internet.

I have included a script to process and install a wordlist that has been made
[available](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html).

If you wish to use this dataset you should cite one of the following two papers:

       Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2004), Aug 22-25, 2004, Seattle,
