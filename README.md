TrendAnalyser
==================

The TrendAnalyser project is a Twitter data gathering and processing
project that is being written as part of my 3rd year project at
Southampton University.

Currently it is not in a state of being usable but as soon as it is i will
be adding information how to use it.

It is planned to be designed to gather Twitter data and then be used
to process and analyse the gathered data.
